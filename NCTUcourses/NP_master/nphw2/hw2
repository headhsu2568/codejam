Project #2: remote working ground (rwg)

In this homework, you are asked to design chat-like systems, called
remote working systems (server only).  In this system, users can
meet with/work with/talk to/make friends.  Basically, this system 
supports all functions, as you did in the first project.  In addition, 
all clients can see what all on-line users are working.  


Command Summary: 
* All commands in project 1.  
* who: show all the online users. E.g., 
  <sockd> <nickname>      <IP/port>                    <indicate me>
  3       Iam3            140.113.215.62/1201          <- me
  4       (No Name)       140.113.215.63/1013
  5       student5        140.113.215.64/1302
* tell <sockd> <message>: send only to <user> the message <message>. E.g.,  
        % tell 5 Hello.           # from client #3 (Iam3)
  The user "student5" will receive the following. 
        *** Iam3 told you ***:  Hello.
* yell <message>: broadcast the message <message> to all users. E.g., 
        % yell Hi...
  All users will receive the following. 
        *** student1 yelled ***:  Hi...
* name <name>: set my name to <name> and broacast to all users. E.g., 
        % name student5
  All users will receive the following. 
        *** User from 140.113.215.62/1201 is named 'student5'. ***
* Whenever a client comes in, broadcast as follows. 
        *** User '(no name)' entered from 140.113.215.63/1013. ***
  Whenever a client leaves, broadcast as follows. 
        *** User 'student5' left. ***
* Support stdout piping. For example, 
  User #7, named 'student7', pipes a command into a pipe, owned by himself.
        % cat test.html >|                # Now, the output is piped into . 
  All users see the following message.
        *** student7 (#7) just piped 'cat test.html >|' into his/her pipe. *** 
  The user student3 can use the following to receive the pipe as the standard input.
        % cat <7                          # receive the pipe from student7. 
  Then, all users will receive the following message: 
        *** student3 (#3) just received the pipe from student7 (#7) by 'cat <7' *** 
  Only one user can take the pipe.  So, the second one fails to take it 
  and receive the following error message. 
        *** Error: the pipe from #7 does not exist yet. *** 
  Before the pipe is taken, student7 cannot send to the pipe again. 
  Otherwise, he/she will receive the following error message. 
        *** Error: your pipe already exists. *** 
* Support stderr piping. '>!' is the same as '>|', except for that stderr is also piped. 


The following is a scenario of using the system.

Requirements:

* Write two different server programs. 
  (1) Use the single-process concurrent paradigm.
  (2) Use the concurrent connection-oriented paradigm with shared memory.  

* For each client, all behaviors required by project 1 are still required
  in this project.  

Hints: 

* You can assume that the # of users is <= 30. 

* ">|", ">!" or "<4" has no space between them.  So, you can distinct them 
  from "> filename" easily.  

* For the second program (2), 
  * One chat buffer has at most 10 unread messages, each of which has 
    at most 1024 bytes. 
  * For each pair of clients (A, B), one chat buffer is allocated for A 
    to send messages to B. If the chat buffer is full (10 messages), 
    A needs to wait for B to consume messages.  
  * For each pipe for ">|" or ">!", use FIFO instead of pipe. 
  * If a message has more than 1024 bytes, simply truncate it to 1024 bytes. 
  * If you use BBS-like method, you can use signal "SIGUSR1" or "SIGUSR2" to help.  
  * For "who", the master process maintain an id for each forked process. 
    Since there are no more than 30 processes, id <= 30 and let the id be <sockd>. 

If you find some commands confusing or not workable, please let us know.
